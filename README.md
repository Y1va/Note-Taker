  ## Description

  The ask for this assessment was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker which would be used to save notes. This application also has the ability to delete notes as well as clear them if they are not wanted anymore. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
